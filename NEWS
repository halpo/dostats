Initial Release 2/8/2012

contains two primary functions
  * dostats collects functions into a single function to retruns a single row data frame.
  * compose and the operator alias %.% to nest functions within each other.
Helper functions are:
  * wargs wraps a function with new arguments.
  * class.stats, integer.stats, numeric.stats, and factor.stats help dostats by only doing
    calling the functions if the variable matches the class specified.
    This is very helpful with ldply to create summary tables.
